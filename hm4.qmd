## Question 1
::: {.callout-tip}
## 30 points
Automatic differentiation using `torch`
:::

###### 1.1 (5 points)

Consider $g(x, y)$ given by
$$
g(x, y) = (x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2.
$$

Using elementary calculus derive the expressions for

$$
\frac{d}{dx}g(x, y), \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{d}{dy}g(x, y).
$$

Using your answer from above, what is the answer to
$$
\frac{d}{dx}g(x, y) \Bigg|_{(x=3, y=4)} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{d}{dy}g(x, y) \Bigg|_{(x=3, y=4)} ?
$$

Define $g(x, y)$ as a function in R, compute the gradient of $g(x, y)$ with respect to $x=3$ and $y=4$. Does the answer match what you expected?

###### 1.2 (10 points)


$$\newcommand{\u}{\boldsymbol{u}}\newcommand{\v}{\boldsymbol{v}}$$

Consider $h(\u, \v)$ given by
$$
h(\u, \v) = (\u \cdot \v)^3,
$$
where $\u \cdot \v$ denotes the dot product of two vectors, i.e., $\u \cdot \v = \sum_{i=1}^n u_i v_i.$

Using elementary calculus derive the expressions for the gradients

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_\u h(\u, \v) &= \Bigg(\frac{d}{du_1}h(\u, \v), \frac{d}{du_2}h(\u, \v), \dots, \frac{d}{du_n}h(\u, \v)\Bigg)
\end{aligned}
$$

Using your answer from above, what is the answer to $\nabla_\u h(\u, \v)$ when $n=10$ and

$$
\begin{aligned}
\u = (-1, +1, -1, +1, -1, +1, -1, +1, -1, +1)\\
\v = (-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1)
\end{aligned}
$$

Define $h(\u, \v)$ as a function in R, initialize the two vectors $\u$ and $\v$ as `torch_tensor`s. Compute the gradient of $h(\u, \v)$ with respect to $\u$. Does the answer match what you expected?

---

###### 1.3 (5 points)

Consider the following function
$$
f(z) = z^4 - 6z^2 - 3z + 4
$$

Derive the expression for 
$$
f'(z_0) = \frac{df}{dz}\Bigg|_{z=z_0}
$$
and evaluate $f'(z_0)$ when $z_0 = -3.5$.

Define $f(z)$ as a function in R, and using the `torch` library compute $f'(-3.5)$. 


---

###### 1.4 (5 points)

For the same function $f$, initialize $z[1] = -3.5$, and perform $n=100$ iterations of **gradient descent**, i.e., 

> $z[{k+1}] = z[k] - \eta f'(z[k]) \ \ \ \ $ for $k = 1, 2, \dots, 100$

Plot the curve $f$ and add taking $\eta = 0.02$, add the points $\{z_0, z_1, z_2, \dots z_{100}\}$ obtained using gradient descent to the plot. What do you observe?

---

###### 1.5 (5 points)


Redo the same analysis as **Question 1.4**, but this time using $\eta = 0.03$. What do you observe? What can you conclude from this analysis

## Question 2
::: {.callout-tip}
## 50 points
Logistic regression and interpretation of effect sizes
:::

For this question we will use the **Titanic** dataset from the Stanford data archive. This dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic and whether or not they survived. 


---

###### 2.1 (5 points)

Read the data from the following URL as a tibble in R. Preprocess the data such that the variables are of the right data type, e.g., binary variables are encoded as factors, and convert all column names to lower case for consistency. Let's also rename the response variable `Survival` to `y` for convenience.

```R
url <- "https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1166/stuff/titanic.csv"

df <- ... # Insert your code here
```

---

###### 2.2 (5 points)

Visualize the correlation matrix of all numeric columns in `df` using `corrplot()`

```R
df %>% ... # Insert your code here
```



---

###### 2.3 (10 points)

Fit a logistic regression model to predict the probability of surviving the titanic as a function of:

* `pclass`
* `sex`
* `age`
* `fare`
* `# siblings`
* `# parents`


```R
full_model <- ... # Insert your code here
summary(full_model)
```

---

###### 2.4 (30 points)

Provide an interpretation for the slope and intercept terms estimated in `full_model` in terms of the log-odds of survival in the titanic and in terms of the odds-ratio (if the covariate is also categorical).

::: {.callout-hint}
## 
Recall the definition of logistic regression from the lecture notes, and also recall how we interpreted the slope in the linear regression model (particularly when the covariate was categorical).

## 70 points

Variable selection and logistic regression in `torch`

###### 3.1 (15 points)

Complete the following function `overview` which takes in two categorical vectors (`predicted` and `expected`) and outputs:

* The prediction accuracy
* The prediction error
* The false positive rate, and
* The false negative rate

```R
overview <- function(predicted, expected){
    accuracy <- ... # Insert your code here
    error <- ... # Insert your code here
    total_false_positives <- ... # Insert your code here
    total_true_positives <- ... # Insert your code here
    total_false_negatives <- ... # Insert your code here
    total_true_negatives <- ... # Insert your code here
    false_positive_rate <- ... # Insert your code here
    false_negative_rate <- ... # Insert your code here
    return(
        data.frame(
            accuracy = accuracy, 
            error=error, 
            false_positive_rate = false_positive_rate, 
            false_negative_rate = false_negative_rate
        )
    )
}
```

You can check if your function is doing what it's supposed to do by evaluating

```R
overview(df$y, df$y)
```
and making sure that the accuracy is $100\%$ while the errors are $0\%$.
---

###### 3.2 (5 points)

Display an overview of the key performance metrics of `full_model`

```R
... # Insert your code here
```

---

###### 3.3  (5 points)

Using backward-stepwise logistic regression, find a parsimonious altenative to `full_model`, and print its `overview`

```R
step_model <- ... # Insert your code here. 
summary(step_model)
```

```R
step_predictions <- ... # Insert your code here
overview(step_predictions, df$y)
```

---

###### 3.4  (15 points)

Using the `caret` package, setup a **$5$-fold cross-validation** training method using the `caret::trainConrol()` function

```R
controls <- trainControl() # ... insert your code here
```

Now, using `control`, perform $5$-fold cross validation using `caret::train()` to select the optimal $\lambda$ parameter for LASSO with logistic regression. 

Take the search grid for $\lambda$ to be in $\{ 2^{-20}, 2^{-19.5}, 2^{-19}, \dots, 2^{-0.5}, 2^{0} \}$.

```R
# Insert your code in the ... region
lasso_fit <- train(
  x = ...,
  y = ...,
  method = ...,
  trControl = controls, 
  tuneGrid = expand.grid(
    alpha = ...,
    lambda = 2^seq(-20, 0, by = 0.5)
    ),
  family = ...
)
```
Using the information stored in `lasso_fit$results`, plot the results for  cross-validation accuracy vs. $log_2(\lambda)$. Choose the optimal $\lambda^*$, and report your results for this value of $\lambda^*$.

---

###### 3.5  (25 points)

First, use the `model.matrix()` function to convert the covariates of `df` to a matrix format

```R
covariate_matrix <- model.matrix(full_model)[, -1]
```

Now, initialize the covariates $X$ and the response $y$ as `torch` tensors

```R
X <- ... # Insert your code here
y <- ... # Insert your code here
```

Using the `torch` library, initialize an `nn_module` which performs logistic regression for this dataset. (Remember that we have 6 different covariates)

```R
logistic <- nn_module(
  initialize = function() {
    self$f <- ... # Insert your code here
    self$g <- ... # Insert your code here
  },
  forward = function(x) {
    ... # Insert your code here
  }
)

f <- logistic()
```

You can verify that your code is right by checking that the output to the following code is a vector of probabilities:

```R
f(X)
```


Now, define the loss function `Loss()` which takes in two tensors `X` and `y` and a function `Fun`, and outputs the **Binary cross Entropy loss** between `Fun(X)` and `y`. 

```R
Loss <- function(X, y, Fun){
  ... # Insert our code here
}
```

Initialize an optimizer using `optim_adam()` and perform $n=1000$ steps of gradient descent in order to fit logistic regression using `torch`.

```R
f <- logistic()
optimizer <- optim_adam(...) # Insert your code here

n <- 1000
...  # Insert your code for gradient descent here
```

Using the final, optimized parameters of `f`, compute the compute the predicted results on `X`

```R
predicted_probabilities <- f(X) %>% as_array()
torch_predictions <- ... # Insert your code here

overview(torch_predictions, df$y)
```
